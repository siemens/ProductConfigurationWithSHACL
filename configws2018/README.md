# ProductConfigurationWithSHACL

Some example models and shacl constraints to illustrate how to integrate Semantic Web technologies with established techniques for product configuration like ASP (answer set programming) as described in the paper
"Integrating Semantic Web Technologies and ASP for Product Configuration"
that will be presented at the Configuration Workshop 2018 in Graz

## Content

The example product configuration models (ontologies, shacl constraints etc.) can be found in the \src\main\resources folder.

The main purpose of the Java code is to test the models with JUnit and to illustrate the usage of the example models with Java-APIs.
